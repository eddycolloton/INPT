This is a sample log from the HMSG bash scripting project INPT. Logs created by these scripts will look very similar to this one. The log is intended to aid in troubleshooting and as documentation of the automated processes performed by INPT. 

The log will be created when the scripts begin running. The logos will be named using the following file naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD-HH.MM.SS_INPT.log. 

If the process completes successfully, a copy of the log will be copied to the artwork file in the Technical Info_Specs directory with the other outputs from INPT. The completed log will be renamed using the following naming convention: ArtistLastName_accession_YYYY-MM-DD-HH.MM.SS_INPT.log

The logs directory (the one this file is in) also stores the logs created by the copyit.py python script. The copyit.py script is part of the open source project IFIscripts, (c) 2015-2018 Kieran O'Leary for the Irish Film Institute.

Sample log below:
